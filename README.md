This project was created by Mazen Haouari and Mahmoud Derbel. We developed four algorithms:
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search
* Limited Depth-First Search
* A* Algorithm
The goal is to take input and output as global variables, displaying the number of explored and closed nodes in a graphical interface.
My focus was on algorithm development, while my friend concentrated on the graphical aspects.
